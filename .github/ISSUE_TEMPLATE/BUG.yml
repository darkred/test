      description: "Also tell us, what did you expect to happen? Provide STR (steps to reproduce). <br> When the script doesn't work, is it because it doesn't run at all in the page (check TM/VM's toolbar dropdown button), or because it has errors in Console?         If it's the former them its `@include` rule needs additions. If it's the latter, include the Console errors in the textarea below. "
